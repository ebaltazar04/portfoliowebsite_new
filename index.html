                <img src="images/ScreenShot_1.png">
                <p>This project was my first attempt at using HTML and CSS together in order to generate s style guide sheet for a fictional website</p>

                <img src="images/ScreenShot_2.png">
                <p>This project was my first attempt at using Flexbox along with 
                    HTML and CSS to recreate a static website based on specific 
                    specs provided by codecademy. In addition, I learned to use a 
                    proper file system in order to stay organized.</p>

                <h4>Fotomatic (CSS Grid/Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="images/ScreenShot_3.png">
                <p>This project required me to use CSS Grid and media queries to 
                    modify an existing page from static to responsive. It was also 
                    my first time using media queries to manipulate content to adjust 
                    as the screen size changed to accommodate multiples devices.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Business Site (HTML/CSS/Flexbox/Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="images/ScreenShot_4.png">
                <p>This project gave me the opportunity to create a website of my
                    choice. I decided to create a website for my girlfriend's business. 
                    I was able to generate a website from scratch and use a combination 
                    of HTML, CSS and Flexbox to organize and style my page.</p>

                <h4>Responsive Club Site (Media Queries)</h4>
                <img src="images/ScreenShot_5.png">
                <p>This project also allowed me to add a personal touch to the content
                    of a website. I created a website about the high school football team
                    I helped coach at for 3 years. I practice using media queries and 
                    relative units in CSS to position and size elements. At the end 
                    of this project, I was proud of my progress and gave me the 
                    confidence to continue on my path of web developement.</p>
