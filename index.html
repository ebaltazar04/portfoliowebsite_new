            <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>Hello! My name is Edgardo and I am self taught programmer. 
                My journey began in March of 2022 after meeting up with a good friend 
                from college who first gave me the idea to start learning about coding.
                Shout out to my boy Mario Vega for introducing me to the world of programming. 
                After doing some research, I decided to bet on myself and embark on my long journey of becoming a programmer.
                <br>
                Fast forward 10 month and I have to admit, it's been harder than I expected! And at
                times I've grown impatient and even thought about just giving up.
                But I'm still here! Still at it! Little by little. One day at a time, 
                one line of code at a time.
                <br>
                I've come to realize that learning to code is very similar to my fitness journey:
                If you're doing it right, it's a life long process. There is always something new to learn.
                Something new to implement or something you can improve on or get stonger at.
